# Packaging And Deploying
> **TODO**

> Work out properly. The following was generated by Quarkus
 
The application can be built and packaged using:

```
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory and is runnable via
`java -jar .\target\quarkus-app\quarkus-run.jar`.

Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

> **Note:** To run the application in a docker container, the whole `target/quarkus-app` needs to be copied over.

Alternatively a _über-jar_ can be created (includes all dependencies) by executing the following command:

```
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

It includes all dependencies and is now runnable using `java -jar target/learning-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

#### Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/learning-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
